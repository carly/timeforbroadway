Audition Time Form
1. Audition Model, Auditions Controller, Auditions Routes
2. Associations: Actors w/ Audition Times

- POTENTIALLY: Integrating jQuery to create collapsing views for audition times?

- POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:
- WAITLIST
+ Actors who sign up after auditions are full get put on a waitlist
+ Another Waitlist Model, Controller, Routes
+ GOOGLE MAPS API INTEGRATION-CHECK-IN: 
+ Add Google Maps API… If an actor given a particular audition slot  doesn’t “check in” 1 hr in advance, they lose their spot, and it is given to the first person on the waitlist
+ Create Associations with Actors and Waitlist
+ Create a Check-in system with Google Maps API...
REACH GOALS: 
+ CREDIT CARD FEE: If you don’t physically check-in on time, you lose your spot and are charged $20. 
+ TEXT-MESSAGING: If auditions are running behind, the casting director can push back all audition times by X minutes and inform all actors by text message

-TIMELINE ESTIMATES (NOT INCLUDING REACH GOALS): 

-BACKEND
1. ACTOR SECTION: 1-2 hours
2. CASTING DIRECTOR SECTION: 1-2 Hours
3. AUDITION SECTION: 1-2 hours

-FRONT END
1. PAGE VIEWS: 3-4 hours

-API INTEGRATION: 
1. This will probably take the longest… 5-6 hours?

-JQUERY SECTION
1. (If we can figure out how to sync w/ Rails…) 2 hours
